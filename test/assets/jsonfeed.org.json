It&#8217;s a\nbunch of friggin&#8217; boxes. All half-ass records. We have about 50\nATF employees. And all the rest are basically the ladies. The\nladies that live in West Virginia &#8212; and they got a job.

He&#8217;s already gone three rounds on the\nwhiteboard, scribbling, erasing, illustrating some of the finer\npoints of gun tracing, of which there are many, in large part due\nto the limitations imposed upon this place. For example, no\ncomputer. The National Tracing Center is not allowed to have\ncentralized computer data.</p>\n\n<p>“That&#8217;s the big no-no,” says Charlie.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s been a federal law, thanks to the NRA, since 1986: No\nsearchable database of America&#8217;s gun owners. So people here have\nto use paper, sort through enormous stacks of forms and record\nbooks that gun stores are required to keep and to eventually turn\nover to the feds when requested. It&#8217;s kind of like a library in\nthe old days &#8212; but without the card catalog. They can use\npictures of paper, like microfilm (they recently got the go-ahead\nto convert the microfilm to PDFs), as long as the pictures of\npaper are not searchable. You have to flip through and read. No\nsearching by gun owner. No searching by name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The legislation that keeps the ATF from computerizing these records is lunacy, based entirely on the fever dream that such a database would lead to mass confiscation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <em><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/255517926\">Guns Found Here</a></em>, a bracing, compelling 10-minute short from MEL Films that really hammers home how insane the constraints on the ATF National Trace Center are.

But this is an academic query:\nchanges to the constitution require the unlikely assent of\ntwo-thirds majorities in the House and Senate and three-quarters\nof the states. The better question is whether repealing the\namendment is a must for pursuing gun control. It is not. The\nHeller majority opinion did not, in the words of its author, the\nlate Justice Antonin Scalia, secure an “unlimited” right to buy or\ncarry weapons. The Second Amendment would not, for example,\nscuttle bans on concealed weapons or machine guns. And Justice\nScalia emphasised that nothing in Heller “should be taken to cast\ndoubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms\nby felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of\nfirearms in sensitive places such as schools and government\nbuildings”. Nearly every gun regulation under discussion today &#8212;\nfrom expanded background checks to bans on military-style weapons\n&#8212; would seem to pass constitutional muster.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s remarkable how effective the NRA has been at convincing people that the 2nd Amendment means something that it does not. We almost certainly cannot repeal the 2nd Amendment in the foreseeable future, but we absolutely <em>can</em> pass meaningful new gun regulations with the 2nd Amendment in place.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2018/02/economist-explains-14\">economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2018/02/economist</a></strong></em></p>\n"

You can turn this on in Settings → General → Keyboards. When enabled, quotes and apostrophes (like &#34;this&#34; and &#39;this&#39;) are automatically turned into their proper counterparts (like &#8220;this&#8221; and &#8216;this&#8217;), two hyphens in a row (&#45;-) are turned into a proper em-dash (—), etc.</p>\n\n<p>I say &#8220;finally&#8221; because MacOS has had the feature in the standard text editing system for many years, and I can&#8217;t think of a good reason why it wasn&#8217;t in iOS years ago. I can say it&#8217;s not a difficult programming job to solve because <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/\">I&#8217;ve solved it</a> in the more difficult context of smartening punctuation in prose without messing up the necessary dumb quotes inside HTML tags.</p>\n\n<p>In some recent update to iOS (I think 11.2.5, but it might have been an earlier 11.2.x update), smart punctuation stopped working in Messages &#8212; and as far as I can tell, only Messages. Why? My best guess: unintended consequences when sending SMS messages.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/87450\">Here&#8217;s a thread on Apple&#8217;s help forum addressing the issue</a>. SMS is such an old standard that it was designed with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII\">ASCII character set</a> in mind. An SMS message containing only ASCII characters can contain up to 160 characters. Include even just a single non-ASCII character, though &#8212; such as a curly quote or apostrophe, or an emoji &#8212; and the entire message must be encoded using a 16-bit alphabet, limiting the message to just 70 characters because the length of the message in bytes remains fixed by the protocol.<sup id=\"fnr1-2018-02-20\"><a href=\"#fn1-2018-02-20\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>In short: if you stick to dumb quotes, you can put 160 characters in an SMS message. Include just one smart/curly quote, and you only get 70 characters.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know for sure that this is why iOS 11&#8217;s smart punctuation feature no longer works in Messages, but it&#8217;s the only explanation that I can think of. (I&#8217;ve seen some speculation that this might be a machine learning bug, but machine learning bugs, like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/01/ios-11-predictive-text-bug/\">infamous &#8220;I → weird-looking A&#8221; fiasco</a> from a few months ago, aren&#8217;t limited to one app like Messages. And &#8220;Smart Punctuation&#8221; is a separate setting from &#8220;Predictive Text&#8221; in the Settings app &#8212; you can use either without the other.)</p>\n\n<p>But if I&#8217;m right about why, then why does it apply to iMessage messages &#8212; a.k.a. blue-bubble messages &#8212; too? iMessage messages aren&#8217;t limited by the antiquated constraints of SMS in any other way, so why limit them typographically?</p>\n\n<p>This is a story with a happy ending, because it looks like iOS 11.3 will fix this. After installing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/02/20/apple-seeds-ios-11-3-beta-3-to-developers/\">today&#8217;s new 11.3 developer beta</a> on both an iPad and iPhone, smart punctuation is back when writing a (blue) iMessage, and is disabled only when writing a (green) SMS.<sup id=\"fnr2-2018-02-20\"><a href=\"#fn2-2018-02-20\">2</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Smart.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-2018-02-20\">\n<p>Technically, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS#Message_size\">SMS messages use the GSM-7 text encoding</a>, not ASCII. But like ASCII, GSM-7 is a 7-bit encoding limited to just 128 characters.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2018-02-20\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-2018-02-20\">\n<p>It still isn&#8217;t as smart as it could be. Consider the case of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nosenkow/status/966077457056100352\">people who write in a language that requires 16-bit encoding</a>, and thus are limited to 70 characters in all their SMS messages. Why disable smart punctuation for them?&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr2-2018-02-20\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    "

David Foster Wallace in 2006 on then-25-year-old Roger Federer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Moments are more intense if you’ve played enough tennis to\nunderstand the impossibility of what you just saw him do. We’ve\nall got our examples. Here is one. It’s the finals of the 2005\nU.S. Open, Federer serving to Andre Agassi early in the fourth\nset. There’s a medium-long exchange of groundstrokes, one with the\ndistinctive butterfly shape of today’s power-baseline game,\nFederer and Agassi yanking each other from side to side, each\ntrying to set up the baseline winner&#8230;until suddenly Agassi hits\na hard heavy cross-court backhand that pulls Federer way out wide\nto his ad (=left) side, and Federer gets to it but slices the\nstretch backhand short, a couple feet past the service line, which\nof course is the sort of thing Agassi dines out on, and as\nFederer’s scrambling to reverse and get back to center, Agassi’s\nmoving in to take the short ball on the rise, and he smacks it\nhard right back into the same ad corner, trying to wrong-foot\nFederer, which in fact he does &#8212; Federer’s still near the corner\nbut running toward the centerline, and the ball’s heading to a\npoint behind him now, where he just was, and there’s no time to\nturn his body around, and Agassi’s following the shot in to the\nnet at an angle from the backhand side&#8230;and what Federer now does\nis somehow instantly reverse thrust and sort of skip backward\nthree or four steps, impossibly fast, to hit a forehand out of his\nbackhand corner, all his weight moving backward, and the forehand\nis a topspin screamer down the line past Agassi at net, who lunges\nfor it but the ball’s past him, and it flies straight down the\nsideline and lands exactly in the deuce corner of Agassi’s side, a\nwinner &#8212; Federer’s still dancing backward as it lands. And\nthere’s that familiar little second of shocked silence from the\nNew York crowd before it erupts, and John McEnroe with his color\nman’s headset on TV says (mostly to himself, it sounds like), “How\ndo you hit a winner from that position?” And he’s right: given\nAgassi’s position and world-class quickness, Federer had to send\nthat ball down a two-inch pipe of space in order to pass him,\nwhich he did, moving backwards, with no setup time and none of his\nweight behind the shot. It was impossible. It was like something\nout of “The Matrix.” I don’t know what-all sounds were involved,\nbut my spouse says she hurried in and there was popcorn all over\nthe couch and I was down on one knee and my eyeballs looked like\nnovelty-shop eyeballs.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, that’s one example of a Federer Moment, and that was\nmerely on TV &#8212; and the truth is that TV tennis is to live tennis\npretty much as video porn is to the felt reality of human love.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Oh how I wish Wallace were still alive to see Federer <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/breaking-news-ageless-federer-downs-200056757.html\">reclaim the world&#8217;s number one ranking</a> at the heretofore unheard of age of 36.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html\">nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html</a></strong></em></p>\n"

The first to argue\notherwise, written by a William and Mary law student named Stuart\nR. Hays, appeared in 1960. He began by citing an article in the\nNRA’s American Rifleman magazine and argued that the amendment\nenforced a “right of revolution,” of which the Southern states\navailed themselves during what the author called “The War Between\nthe States.”</p>\n\n<p>At first, only a few articles echoed that view. Then, starting in\nthe late 1970s, a squad of attorneys and professors began to churn\nout law review submissions, dozens of them, at a prodigious rate.\nFunds &#8212; much of them from the NRA &#8212; flowed freely. An essay\ncontest, grants to write book reviews, the creation of “Academics\nfor the Second Amendment,” all followed. In 2003, the NRA\nFoundation provided $1 million to endow the Patrick Henry\nprofessorship in constitutional law and the Second Amendment at\nGeorge Mason University Law School.</p>\n\n<p>This fusillade of scholarship and pseudo-scholarship insisted that\nthe traditional view &#8212; shared by courts and historians &#8212; was\nwrong. There had been a colossal constitutional mistake. Two\ncenturies of legal consensus, they argued, must be overturned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t need to repeal the 2nd Amendment &#8212; although I think we should, insofar as it is inexplicably ambiguously written and punctuated &#8212; we just need to flip the Supreme Court to interpret it as it had been from 1789 through 2008.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/nra-guns-second-amendment-106856?o=1\">politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/nra-guns-second</a></strong></em></p>\n"

It is an object of reverence. Devotion to it precludes interruption with the sacrifices it entails. Like most gods, it does what it will, and cannot be questioned. Its acolytes think it is capable only of good things. It guarantees life and safety and freedom. It even guarantees law. Law grows from it. Then how can law question it?</p>\n\n<p>Its power to do good is matched by its incapacity to do anything wrong. It cannot kill. Thwarting the god is what kills. If it seems to kill, that is only because the god’s bottomless appetite for death has not been adequately fed. The answer to problems caused by guns is more guns, millions of guns, guns everywhere, carried openly, carried secretly, in bars, in churches, in offices, in government buildings. Only the lack of guns can be a curse, not their beneficent omnipresence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Our gun laws are insane. We, collectively, have agreed that regular mass shootings, often at schools — <em>schools!</em> — are a reasonable price to pay as a nation for unfettered access to military-grade killing machines for anyone and everyone who wants one.</p>\n\n<p>It’s sick. Everyone outside the U.S. knows this. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/11/gun-control-vegas-polls-243647\">A majority of Americans knows this</a> and supports stricter gun control.</p>\n\n<p>There are new gun laws being drafted.

There&#8217;s another part of me that wants to sell ads and keep this thing afloat, and knows that I sell more ads when I periodically mention that there are ads for sale.</p>\n\n<p>Right now there are three ways to sponsor my work:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/\">Weekly sponsorships</a>. I just updated the public-facing schedule, and there are a few openings in the coming weeks. And, this very week remains open (long story short: last-minute cancellation). Given that it&#8217;s already Wednesday, the remainder of this week could be yours for a substantial discount. Get in touch.</p>\n\n<p>These weekly sponsorships have been the number one source of revenue for Daring Fireball ever since I started selling them <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive\">back in 2007</a>. They&#8217;ve succeeded, I think, because they make everyone happy. They generate good money. There&#8217;s only one sponsor per week and the sponsors are always relevant to at least some sizable portion of the DF audience, so you, the reader, are never annoyed and hopefully often intrigued by them. And, from the sponsors&#8217; perspective, they work. My favorite thing about them is how many sponsors <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive\">return for subsequent weeks</a> after seeing the results.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2017/07/df_display_ads\">Display ads</a>. These are new &#8212; my little homegrown replacement for <a href=\"http://decknetwork.net/\">The Deck</a> (R.I.P.). I&#8217;ve been selling these since last summer, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve mentioned them enough here. Right now I&#8217;m selling spots for March for $3,500. I don&#8217;t have a landing page to promote them, but if you&#8217;re interested, <a href=\"&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#116;o:&#x73;&#112;&#111;&#x6E;&#x73;&#x6F;&#x72;&#115;&#64;&#x64;a&#x72;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#x66;&#x69;&#x72;e&#98;&#97;&#108;&#108;&#x2E;&#x6E;&#101;&#116;?subject=Feed%20Sponsorship\">get in touch</a>. (You can also buy both a weekly sponsorship <em>and</em> a display ad and get a discount.)</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://neat.fm/\">Sponsoring The Talk Show</a>. This is something I seldom mention here on Daring Fireball, but I think sponsoring The Talk Show would be a great opportunity for a lot of the same services and products that sponsor the website. I love the regular sponsors of the show &#8212; and the fact that so many of them return repeatedly speaks well to the results they see. But I would love to get some more variety into the list of sponsors for the show. I don&#8217;t sell these myself, but if you have a product or service you think would be of interest to The Talk Show&#8217;s audience, <a href=\"http://neat.fm/\">get in touch with Jessie Char at Neat.fm</a>. We still have a few openings for the remainder of Q1, and first-time sponsors are eligible for a rate <em>below</em> the listed price of $4,000 per spot.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n    "

I can’t churn out 60 things a day and\nplay that social game where you use the shotgun approach to spit\nstuff out there and see what sticks. I’ve got to do four, five,\nsix things that are good, really good. Since then, though, I’ve\nsort of come to terms with that. I’m like: Okay, if I can just\nkeep going it, just keep doing it, it will work itself out\nsomehow. I don’t know why I think that, but I kind of do.</p>\n\n<p>The membership thing was actually really helpful in that regard,\nbecause within a pretty short amount of time, there was a lot of\nsignal that people really appreciate what it is I do, enough that\nthey’re willing to pay for it.

I knew before that there were people\nwho really into the site and who really like it, and that’s always\nbeen great to know and to get that feedback in the inbox and via\nTwitter and stuff like that.

Other reviewers and\nowners (such as <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/smart-home/reviews/apple/141256-apple-homepod-review-the-smart-sounding-speaker-that-s-just-not-smart-enough\">Pocket-lint</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Guyinsf415/status/962459450123538433\">folks on Twitter</a>) have\nreported the same issue, which an Apple representative has\nconfirmed. Apple says “the marks can improve over several days\nafter the speaker is removed from the wood surface,” and if they\ndon’t fade on their own, you can basically just go refinish the\nfurniture &#8212; the exact advice Apple gave in an email to Wirecutter\nwas to “try cleaning the surface with the manufacturer’s suggested\noiling method.” This really undermines the design aspect of the\nHomePod &#8212; especially if you were thinking of displaying it on\nsome prized piece of furniture &#8212; and it will surely be a sore\npoint for many potential buyers. In other testing, we have seen no\nvisible damage when using it on glass, granite countertop, nice\nMDF, polyurethane-sealed wood, and cheap IKEA bookcases. We also\ntested the HomePod in the same place a Sonos One regularly lives\n&#8212; and the Sonos hasn’t caused damage in months of use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I haven&#8217;t seen anything like this, but I haven&#8217;t placed a HomePod on stained wood, either. Anyone who runs into this should be outraged. I honestly don&#8217;t see how this could happen. Apple has been making products that go on shelves and tables for years &#8212; AirPort base stations, Apple TV, various docks &#8212; and I&#8217;ve never seen a report of damage to a surface. I guess the difference with HomePod is that the base factors into the acoustics, but still, this seems like an issue that should have been caught during the period where HomePod was being widely tested at home by many Apple employees.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci/status/963875248868388864\">Federico Viticci</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Like many recent Apple PR debacles, this HomePod ring problem\ncould have been easily avoided by simply… telling people\nbeforehand.</p>\n\n<p>Explain how things work.

For Mac apps to survive, they must\ncapitalize on their strengths: superior performance, better system\nintegration, better dev experience, more features, and higher\ngeneral quality.</p>\n\n<p>But the app sandbox strikes at all of those. In return it offers\nsecurity inferior to a web app, as this post illustrates. The\nprice is far too high and the benefits too little.</p>\n\n<p>IMO Apple should drop the Mac app sandbox altogether (though\ncontinue to sandbox system services, which is totally sensible,\nand maybe retain something geared towards browsers.) The code\nsigning requirements and dev cert revocation, which has been\nsuccessfully used to remotely disable malware, will be sufficient\nsecurity: the Mac community is good at sussing out bad actors. But\nforce Mac devs to castrate their apps even more, and there won&#8217;t\nbe anything left to protect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In a follow-up comment, <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16352284\">Ammon enumerates <em>why</em></a> truly native Cocoa apps are both worth creating and better to use.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m with Ammon: I think the Mac&#8217;s (relatively) recent move to cryptographically signed applications &#8212; with certificates that can be revoked by Apple &#8212; has been a win all around for security. But I don&#8217;t think the Mac sandbox has. The sandboxed nature of all iOS apps works because that&#8217;s how iOS was designed from the ground up. That&#8217;s why iOS is a better platform than the Mac for non-expert users in most ways. But the Mac was not designed with sandboxing in mind, and in many ways sandboxing works against what keeps the Mac relevant alongside iOS. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2010/12/future_of_the_mac_in_an_ios_world\">As I wrote seven years ago</a>: &#8220;It’s the heaviness of the Mac that allows iOS to remain light.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The whole point of the Mac is to be a great platform for native Mac apps. Sandboxing doesn&#8217;t help Mac apps do more. If the Mac devolves into a platform where people just use web browsers and cross-platform Electron apps, it might as well not exist, because the only remaining thing that would distinguish it from other desktop OSes is iCloud integration.</p>\n\n<p>Mac apps have been able to &#8220;see&#8221; the entire display ever since the Mac debuted. The Mac needs the power to allow the user to shoot themselves in the foot. Or perhaps better said, the Mac needs the power for apps to shoot the user in the foot. On the Mac, you need to trust any software you install, particularly from outside the App Store. A Mac where all apps are guaranteed &#8220;safe&#8221; is no longer a Mac. Further restricting sandboxed Mac apps would be solving a problem the platform doesn&#8217;t have. The real problems facing the Mac are the number of developers creating non-native &#8220;Mac&#8221; apps and the number of users who don&#8217;t have a problem with them.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

         "content_html" : "\n<p>I&#8217;ve been testing Apple&#8217;s new HomePod for the last week or so, and this is the first product review I&#8217;ve written that could be accurately summarized in the length of a tweet, and an old-school 140-character tweet at that: HomePod does exactly what Apple says it does, doesn&#8217;t do anything more than what Apple says it does, and costs $349. There.</p>\n\n<p>To wit, Apple says HomePod:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Has great audio quality.</li>\n<li>Is easy to set up.</li>\n<li>Makes it easy to play audio content from Apple (Apple Music, iTunes Store, iCloud Music Library, podcasts from iTunes&#8217;s directory).</li>\n<li>Has primary interaction via Siri. You just talk to HomePod.</li>\n<li>Allows secondary interaction using HomePod as an AirPlay speaker.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All of this is true.</p>\n\n<p>Apple&#8217;s product names are sometimes <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/x_man\">inscrutable</a>, but other times are perfectly sensible. AirPods and HomePod are such a case. The two products are very much siblings: they play audio wirelessly and are controlled via Siri and a few simple touch controls. What AirPods are for your own ears, HomePod is for your home. Even the setup process for each device is similar. In the same way that you begin the pairing process for AirPods by opening their case a few inches from your iPhone, you set up HomePod just by plugging it in and then bringing your iPhone (running iOS 11.2.5 or later) near the HomePod.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a room in your home or workspace where you would like to listen to music from Apple and/or podcasts, and you care about audio quality, you should absolutely consider HomePod. If you&#8217;re looking for something else, you probably shouldn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n<p>What&#8217;s missing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Siri-driven content from non-Apple sources.</strong> Spotify is the service most people seem to be talking about, but for now at least, <em>nothing</em> works through &#8220;Hey Siri&#8221; with HomePod other than content from Apple. HomePod works fine as an AirPlay speaker, but in loose terms, I would say playing audio via AirPlay is to native &#8220;Hey Siri, play &#8230;&#8221; support on HomePod as web apps are to native apps on iOS or Mac: better than nothing but clunky compared to the real deal. (I should add here: when playing content on HomePod via AirPlay, you can, as you&#8217;d expect, say things like &#8220;Hey Siri, pause&#8221; or &#8220;Hey Siri, set the volume to 65&#8221;.)</p>\n\n<p>It is unclear at this point whether third-party &#8220;Hey Siri&#8221; playback support is the way Apple wants HomePod to be, simply something they haven&#8217;t gotten around to yet, or still up in the air internally (like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2011/oct/24/steve-jobs-apps-iphone\">native apps on iPhone back in 2007</a>). I&#8217;d sure like to see some sort of native SDK (PodKit?) for HomePod. Some people seem convinced that HomePod doesn&#8217;t support external services through &#8220;Hey Siri&#8221; out of competitive spite toward Spotify. I would say that&#8217;s certainly possible, but I&#8217;m not convinced. Not supporting Spotify might sell some number of new $10/month Apple Music subscriptions, but supporting Spotify properly would sell some number of $349 HomePods that wouldn&#8217;t otherwise be purchased. Apple makes money from both hardware and services, and my gut says they&#8217;ll make the most money by making HomePod more useful, even if that means opening up an SDK that allows for competitors to Apple Music. (Plus, with The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-music-on-track-to-overtake-spotify-in-u-s-subscribers-1517745720\">reporting that Apple Music is set to overtake Spotify in U.S. subscribers</a>, it doesn&#8217;t seem like Apple Music needs any help.)</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Any sort of hardware input, such as line-in audio.</strong> This means you can&#8217;t connect HomePod to anything to use it as a &#8220;normal&#8221; speaker. This seems to greatly bother some people, but it should surprise no one in the aftermath of Apple&#8217;s removal of headphone jacks from iPhones in 2016. HomePod is very much a &#8220;skating to where the puck is going to be&#8221; product, and Apple has believed for years that when it comes to personal audio, the puck is heading toward a wireless world.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Support for promised features like multi-room audio and pairing two HomePods in the same room to act as a stereo pair.</strong> These features both require AirPlay 2, which is obviously late, but &#8220;Coming later this year&#8221;. If either of these features is important to you, you might as well wait for them.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Support for multiple iCloud accounts and identifying users by their voice.</strong> As HomePod stands today, you set it up with one iCloud account, and if you enable the feature where you can create things like notes and reminders by Hey Siri-ing HomePod, that&#8217;s the account where those notes and reminders will show up. This is a bummer. Clearly, in an ideal world you should be able to set up multiple iCloud accounts with HomePod and match each account to the respective user&#8217;s voice. That&#8217;s a hard technical problem to solve, but so too is having a phone verify your identity by your face or fingerprint. And in the case of HomePod, I don&#8217;t think this would have to be as secure as Face ID or Touch ID are. In the scenario I&#8217;m imagining, you could say something like &#8220;Hey Siri, remind me to stop at the bank on my way to work tomorrow&#8221; and if Siri wasn&#8217;t confident about which household member you are, she could ask.</p>\n\n<p>Another downside: Apple brags about Siri being smart enough to learn your musical tastes. But tied to a lone iCloud account, Siri is only learning the tastes of that user. If you&#8217;re worried about your teenager (or perhaps worse, young child) polluting your personal Apple Music profile with songs you don&#8217;t like (a very likely &#8212; if not near-certain &#8212; scenario for many families), you can turn this feature off. But then nobody in the house gets &#8220;smart music&#8221;. Apple, as usual, wouldn&#8217;t comment on future plans, but I can&#8217;t help but think they are hard at work on this. A family device ought to work well for everyone in the family.</p>\n\n<p>And, notably: <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/04/20/why-it-matters-that-google-home-can-now-identify-you-by-voice/\">Google Home can identify users by voice and supports multiple accounts already</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/11/16460120/amazon-echo-multi-user-voice-new-feature\">Alexa can identify users by voice</a> (albeit with lesser support for multiple accounts).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Audio Quality</h2>\n\n<p>Audio quality is what Apple is hanging HomePod&#8217;s hat on, and to my ears, they&#8217;ve nailed it. In a side-by-side comparison in a fairly representative residential room during a product briefing with Apple last week, HomePod sounded better than a <a href=\"https://store.google.com/us/product/google_home_max?hl=en-US\">Google Home Max</a> ($399) or an Alexa-powered <a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/one.html\">Sonos One</a> ($199), and so much better than a second-generation <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-echo-speaker-with-wifi-alexa-dark-charcoal/dp/B06XCM9LJ4\">Amazon Echo</a> ($89) that it proved only that HomePod and Echo are at opposite ends of the product category.</p>\n\n<p>Apple claims two primary reasons for HomePod&#8217;s audio quality. First, an old-fashioned cause: high-quality hardware. Seven good tweeters arranged in a circle around the base, and one good woofer at the top. The second reason is decidedly, well, <em>new-fashioned</em>: dynamic features that adjust playback by analyzing both the music <em>and</em> the acoustics of the room.</p>\n\n<p>During a small media tour of Apple&#8217;s audio lab in Cupertino last week, Kate Bergeron, a vice president of hardware engineering at Apple, told us that the HomePod project started &#8220;about six years ago&#8221; with the basic question: How much better could a small loudspeaker sound if an advanced A-series chip was put to use to dynamically analyze both the audio and the acoustics of the room?</p>\n\n<p>I believe this origin story. First, &#8220;<em>What if we turned ____ into a small advanced computer?</em>&#8221; is arguably Apple&#8217;s mantra for entering new product categories. AirPods, for example, are tiny iOS-derived computers. So is Apple Watch. And when the iPhone debuted, the notion that Apple got OS X running on a device as small as a cell phone was literally <a href=\"http://www.macnn.com/articles/10/12/27/rim.thought.apple.was.lying.on.iphone.in.2007/\">unbelievable</a>. Second, the acoustic performance of HomePod really does seem remarkable. I am not an audiophile, but it clearly sounds &#8220;worth $350&#8221; to my ears. At home we&#8217;ve mostly used it in our kitchen, an acoustically challenging room with mostly hard, echoey surfaces (countertops, cabinets, tile backsplashes, windows) and a high ceiling. Previously, we&#8217;ve used a first-generation Amazon Echo in there. HomePod sounds far richer than the Echo, no surprise. It should, for the price.</p>\n\n<p>But what has impressed me most about HomePod&#8217;s performance in our kitchen is &#8212; somewhat amusingly given the name of the product it&#8217;s replacing &#8212; the lack of echo. I can say with certainty that HomePod&#8217;s hardware speakers are excellent for a $349 product. I can&#8217;t prove that its dynamic &#8220;adjust to the acoustics of the room&#8221; features are making a significant difference, but I believe it. The lack of echo exceeds my expectations. The sound also seems more three-dimensional than seemingly should be possible for one small speaker. (HomePod is both smaller and heavier than I expected.) It does not magically sound like true stereo speakers in multiple locations in the room, but music definitely sounds <em>thicker</em> than what my gut says should be coming out of one speaker.<sup id=\"fnr1-2018-02-06\"><a href=\"#fn1-2018-02-06\">1</a></sup> I sort of wish there were a diagnostic mode I could put HomePod in to disable the dynamic features and see what it sounds like without them for A/B comparison purposes.</p>\n\n<h2>Where to Use It</h2>\n\n<p>Or perhaps better put: Where shouldn&#8217;t you use HomePod? The one glaring answer is in your home theater setup. HomePod is not intended to serve as the audio output for your home theater or TV. As mentioned above, there&#8217;s no line-in input. The only input is AirPlay. Apple TV does support AirPlay speakers, and HomePod does work that way. From the main Apple TV home screen, just hold down the Play button on the remote and you can choose from available AirPlay speakers. Choose your HomePod and yes, it&#8217;ll work. But that&#8217;s only useful if Apple TV is the only input source you use on your TV. I suspect there are very few people for whom that&#8217;s true. And even if you do use Apple TV exclusively, AirPlay 1 necessitates a second or two of latency. (More on that below.) HomePod is a standalone device, not a home theater component.</p>\n\n<p>I can see why Apple did this. There&#8217;s a wonderful simplicity to HomePod. There is no wonderful simplicity in the world of home theater audio. But that means if you want HomePod in the same room with your TV (and want better audio than what you get out of your TV&#8217;s built-in speakers), you still need a separate speaker system for your TV. That seems inefficient.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, HomePod seems like a great product for any room in which you might want to listen to music or podcasts from a loudspeaker.</p>\n\n<h2>Siri Control</h2>\n\n<p>HomePod&#8217;s understanding of voice commands is fast and accurate. The most interesting feature is that HomePod can hear your commands while loud music is playing even if you speak at a normal talking volume. This sounds (sorry) too good to be true, but in my testing it works uncannily well. I would go so far as to say that HomePod can understand commands spoken at normal volume while music is playing better than human ears do. It works so well that I&#8217;m not sure most people will even think to try it. Intuitively, one thinks one must speak <em>over</em> the music to be heard. And, with Amazon Echo, that&#8217;s true. But not so with HomePod. You can&#8217;t just whisper to it, and HomePod can&#8217;t read lips <a href=\"https://youtu.be/QFSE4dUJYM8?t=2m12s\">like HAL can</a>, but I think it&#8217;s worth emphasizing that you do not have to yell. Some impressive engineering went into this.</p>\n\n<h2>The Competition and Smart Home Stuff</h2>\n\n<p>I wrote about this before I even had a HomePod in my hands (or heard it again in person, after a brief hands-off demo at WWDC), but <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/01/homepod_priorities\">HomePod and Amazon&#8217;s Alexa products clearly were designed with very different priorities</a>. HomePod&#8217;s highest priority is audio quality. Amazon&#8217;s Alexa products are designed to be affordable voice assistants. It&#8217;s telling that after the original Echo, the next product in Amazon&#8217;s lineup wasn&#8217;t a higher-end product with better sound quality, but instead the even smaller Echo Dot.</p>\n\n<p>We have a few smart home products in our home: lights and window shades. Neither are set up for use through HomeKit yet, so I wasn&#8217;t able to test either of them with HomePod (again: yet). We do have them set up for control through Alexa, but no one in the house (me, my wife, or my son) is particularly enamored with using Alexa to interact with these things. Part of it is that at least through the products we own, the verbal interaction with Alexa is stilted. We have to say &#8220;Alexa, turn on <em>«name of predefined scene»</em>&#8221;. For example, &#8220;Alexa, turn on kitchen shades down&#8221; or &#8220;Alexa, turn on living room shades up&#8221;, where &#8220;kitchen shades down&#8221;, &#8220;kitchen shades up&#8221;, &#8220;living room shades up&#8221;, and &#8220;living room shades down&#8221; are all predefined scenes created in an <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lutron-connect-radiora2-hwqs/id1046093347?mt=8\">iPhone app from Lutron</a>, the maker of our shades and light controls. But we can&#8217;t just say &#8220;Alexa, open the kitchen shades&#8221; or whatever else one might say naturally. It&#8217;s very much like a verbal command line, linguistically stilted, and generally less convenient and certainly more error-prone than using the hardware remote controls for the shades and good old-fashioned wall switches for the lights.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen a lot of commentary along the lines of &#8220;<em>Well, of course Apple is promoting HomePod&#8217;s audio quality, because Siri sucks compared to Alexa and Google Home as a voice assistant.</em>&#8221; I would argue that&#8217;s not true across the board, but it&#8217;s inarguably true that Alexa and Google Home are far better than Siri <em>at certain things</em>, and if those things are important to you, you probably aren&#8217;t even reading this review, because you know HomePod isn&#8217;t for you.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to look at differing priorities is this. I think Amazon (certainly) and Google (probably) created their voice assistant hardware as a way to get their voice assistants into your home. Something along the lines of, &#8220;We have this great voice assistant technology, we should build a dedicated device for the home that uses it.&#8221; With Android, Google has millions of phones out there that can make use of their voice assistant technology. But with Amazon, without dedicated Alexa hardware, who would even be using Alexa?</p>\n\n<p>With Apple, what came first was the product: a great-sounding loudspeaker with dynamically adjusted acoustics. The decision to use Siri as the primary interface came after the decision to make a loudspeaker. It&#8217;s the difference between &#8220;Let&#8217;s make a speaker to get Alexa into the home&#8221; and &#8220;Let&#8217;s use Siri because voice would be the best interface for a home speaker&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>So I don’t really think it’s a hard decision between HomePod and Echo. The harder decisions are choosing between HomePod, the Alexa-equipped Sonos One, and Google&#8217;s Home Max. Based on my side-by-side listening experience &#8212; admittedly, in a demo set up and conducted by Apple, but in a residential room that I would describe as very typical in terms of its size and acoustics &#8212; HomePod does sound better. But I think the decision should come down to ecosystems. If you&#8217;re personally invested in the Google or Amazon ecosystem, either for music content or smart home control, and you want &#8220;good&#8221; audio quality, you&#8217;d probably be happier with the Sonos One or Home Max, because the advantages of using the  voice assistant native to the ecosystem in which you&#8217;re invested outweigh the HomePod&#8217;s superior audio quality. (Same thing goes if you&#8217;re a happy Spotify user &#8212; buy the best sounding device that natively supports Spotify.)</p>\n\n<p>If, on the other hand, you&#8217;re heavily invested in Apple&#8217;s ecosystem, and subscribe to either Apple Music or iTunes Match or have a large library of purchased music from iTunes, HomePod is a compelling standalone product today, and should be a compelling multi-room product when AirPlay 2 ships.</p>\n\n<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>AirPlay 1.</strong> HomePod works fine as an AirPlay speaker. But I say &#8220;fine&#8221; rather than &#8220;great&#8221; because of the limitations of AirPlay 1, specifically latency. One of the main features Apple is touting about AirPlay 2 is reduced latency and lag, and that&#8217;s the worst part about using HomePod via AirPlay today. I&#8217;ve listened to a bunch of podcasts on HomePod this week, but after testing the native &#8220;Hey Siri, play the latest episode of <em>«insert podcast name»</em>&#8221; support just to see how it worked (pretty well), I mostly used <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/\">Overcast</a> to play podcasts via AirPlay from my phone.<sup id=\"fnr2-2018-02-06\"><a href=\"#fn2-2018-02-06\">2</a></sup> As I mentioned above, when using HomePod to play content via AirPlay, you can still say things like &#8220;Hey Siri, pause&#8221; and &#8220;Hey Siri, turn up the volume&#8221;. But, because of the limitations of AirPlay 1, there&#8217;s some noticeable lag. With native (that is to say, non-AirPlay) audio on HomePod, &#8220;Hey Siri, pause&#8221; pauses nearly instantly. With AirPlay, there&#8217;s a wee bit of extra lag &#8212; just enough to make you question whether HomePod heard your command properly and take a breath to repeat the command. AirPlay 2 will hopefully improve this &#8212; providing a better experience even for HomePod users with just one unit.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Don&#8217;t pause after &#8220;Hey Siri&#8221;.</strong> People seem to naturally think they need to pause between saying &#8220;Hey Siri&#8221; and issuing the command or query, but in my experience you don&#8217;t need to. In this review, I&#8217;ve been punctuating directives with a comma after &#8220;Hey Siri&#8221;, but verbally you can speak without any pause: &#8220;Hey Siri what&#8217;s the temperature?&#8221; This is true not just for HomePod but any other device you own with &#8220;Hey Siri&#8221; enabled.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>&#8220;Hey Siri&#8221; doesn&#8217;t get confused.</strong> I don&#8217;t know what kind of wizardry Apple engineered to make this happen, but when you say &#8220;Hey Siri&#8221; to talk to your HomePod, other devices within earshot with &#8220;Hey Siri&#8221; enabled don&#8217;t try to take the command. The home screen on a countertop iPhone does often light up for a moment, but it seems as though HomePod quickly negotiates with the other devices, effectively telling them, &#8220;Let me handle this.&#8221; This has generally been true for all &#8220;Hey Siri&#8221; devices in the past year or so, but it&#8217;s quite noticeable with HomePod.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Volume.</strong> Maximum volume on HomePod is pretty damn loud given its size, but it still sounds good to my ears. When you ask HomePod to turn the volume to 85 or higher (out of 100), Siri will even warn you: &#8220;That&#8217;s very loud, are you sure?&#8221;</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Hardware quality.</strong> My review unit is space gray, but I saw the white models last week too, and they all look and feel very nice. The power cord is perhaps the nicest power cord I&#8217;ve ever seen for any product. The cable is covered with a nice fabric, and it&#8217;s very supple. It coils nicely if you&#8217;re placing HomePod close to an outlet. There&#8217;s no ugly AC adapter or power supply where the plug goes into the wall &#8212; unlike the Echo&#8217;s, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2018/02/homepod-echo-plugs.jpeg\">it&#8217;s just a normal power plug</a>. My only complaint is that the glossy touchpad atop the HomePod is a fingerprint magnet. I wish it had a matte finish or an oleophobic coating.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Settings in Home app.</strong> It took me a few days to realize this, but there are settings for HomePod in the Home app on your iPhone &#8212; where by &#8220;you&#8221; I mean the person whose iCloud account was used to set up the device. In Home, if you just tap the icon for your HomePod device, it acts as a play/pause button. But if you press harder for 3D Touch, or long-press on the icon, it will open a screen where you can see (and manage) alarms that have been set (but not timers,<sup id=\"fnr3-2018-02-06\"><a href=\"#fn3-2018-02-06\">3</a></sup> oddly) and a button named &#8220;Details&#8221; that ought to be named &#8220;Settings&#8221;, because that&#8217;s what it shows when you press it. This is where you can do things like change which iCloud account to use, toggle Listening History (so that the music played by your family members isn&#8217;t used to build a model of what you personally enjoy), and more. Perhaps it&#8217;s simply because I&#8217;m unfamiliar with the Home app, but making these settings available only after a 3D touch or long-press makes them feel hidden.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Privacy.</strong> Here&#8217;s a message I got from a friend the other day:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I think anyone who voluntarily puts these things in their home is\ncompletely nuts. Alexa because Amazon will choose to do\nincreasingly-horrible things until they get caught, Google and\nApple because they will eventually be exploited into doing\nhorrible things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t disagree with that, but my take is slightly different. I&#8217;d say you are not crazy if you don’t want one of these things in your house. But the future is coming, and it will be listening to us. (And watching us.) I trust Apple more than I trust Google or Amazon. But even so, I&#8217;ve had an Alexa in my kitchen for a year. My eyes are wide open to the privacy risks, but the convenience makes it worth it. My favorite thing about HomePod over Echo is that it sounds so much better, but another advantage is that I&#8217;m just more comfortable.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-2018-02-06\">\n<p>During a product briefing with Apple last week before I received my review unit, I did get to hear two paired HomePods playing in stereo in a very open living space. These HomePods were, obviously, running beta software with AirPlay 2. They sounded terrific &#8212; easily twice as good as a lone HomePod playing in the same room. I&#8217;m guessing that AirPlay 2 will ship <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/01/24/airplay-2-rolling-out-ios-11-3/\">sooner rather than later</a> this year, but it must kill the HomePod team at Apple that this feature didn&#8217;t ship at launch, because it sounds <em>crazy</em> good for $700 worth of hardware. &nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2018-02-06\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-2018-02-06\">\n<p>Because I listen to most podcasts from Overcast using headphones, I want to keep my subscriptions and synced playback status in Overcast&#8217;s system. I also like using Overcast&#8217;s playback speed controls to gently speed up podcasts. HomePod&#8217;s native podcast support is convenient, but works best if you use Apple&#8217;s Podcasts app for listening on your phone.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr2-2018-02-06\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn3-2018-02-06\">\n<p>One of the most common uses for these voice assistant devices is setting timers, particularly in the kitchen. It&#8217;s really convenient to set timers &#8212; and check on them &#8212; verbally. Alexa, however, lets you set multiple timers. HomePod doesn&#8217;t. If you try to set a second timer, HomePod tells you that you already have one (and updates you on how much time is left) and asks if you want to replace it. HomePod needs to support multiple timers, and ought to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202110530\">match Alexa</a> by being smart enough to let you name them, so you can ask something like &#8220;Hey Siri, how much time is left on the potatoes?&#8221;&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr3-2018-02-06\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    "

There’s little question\nhere that the HomePod is a speaker first, smart second, bucking\nthe trend of the earliest Echo and Google Home devices. Apple’s\nengineers were able to get a lot of rich and full sound out of\nthat little footprint. The speaker is particularly adept as\nisolating vocals and maintaining often muddled aural aspects, like\nbackground singers and audience sounds in live recordings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The difference between HomePod and Amazon Echo isn&#8217;t that they&#8217;re in different product categories. They&#8217;re in the same category. No one other than a gadget reviewer is going to put both a HomePod and Echo in their kitchen. They&#8217;re going to have one. It is, most certainly, a competition.</p>\n\n<p>The difference is in the priorities behind the devices. All of them are meant to be audio players and useful voice-driven assistants for information, communication, and smart home control. They&#8217;re intended to be adopted fairly widely. But it makes a huge difference what order those priorities are in. HomePod&#8217;s first priority is clearly audio quality. That&#8217;s why it costs $350. Amazon has placed a higher priority on price, which is one reason why Echo doesn&#8217;t sound great.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of the knee-jerk &#8220;<em>Apple has finally lost its goddamn collective mind if they think people are going to spend $350 on a HomePod that costs three times as much as and has far fewer features than an Amazon Echo and they&#8217;re only banging the drum about sound quality because Siri has so many problems</em>&#8221; reaction is entirely from the perspective of people who agree with Amazon&#8217;s priorities regarding Alexa products. Google seems to be in more of a middle ground, offering both an Echo-ish-priced Google Home at $130 and a HomePod-ish-priced $400 Home Max (which, judging from initial reports, clearly does not sound as good as HomePod).</p>\n\n<p>Writing at Medium, I think Lance Ulanoff&#8217;s headline starts the piece off on the wrong foot: &#8220;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@LanceUlanoff/up-close-with-apple-homepod-siris-expensive-new-home-22f1ee0e682\">Up Close With Apple HomePod, Siri’s Expensive New Home</a>&#8221;. If the HomePod&#8217;s primary purpose is to serve as a home for Siri, then yes, it&#8217;s expensive. I imagine that is how Amazon&#8217;s Echo devices came to be: Amazon wanted a way to get Alexa into as many people&#8217;s homes as they could. Alexa came first, the hardware to put it in came second. With HomePod I think it&#8217;s very clear that Apple started with the question of how to create a high-quality speaker for music playback. Using Siri as the primary interface was simply a design decision. But if HomePod&#8217;s primary purpose is to sound better than products like Google Home Max and Sonos One, it is <em>not</em> expensive.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not interested in higher-end audio quality or are mostly interested in the number of assistant features you can add to such a device, HomePod clearly isn&#8217;t for you. I don&#8217;t think that means it&#8217;s for no one, though. <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/homepod-vs-amazon-echo-vs-google-home-max-vs-sonos-one-speaker-showdown\">Serenity Caldwell&#8217;s first look for iMore</a> is the best I&#8217;ve read so far, because it&#8217;s written from the perspective of judging it for what it is, not what its competitors are.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

This feature will launch in\nBeta with the public availability of iOS 11.3 this spring, with\nthe support of select businesses including Discover, Hilton,\nLowe’s and Wells Fargo. With Business Chat, it&#8217;s easy to have a\nconversation with a service representative, schedule an\nappointment or make purchases using Apple Pay in the Messages\napp. Business Chat doesn’t share the user’s contact information\nwith businesses and gives users the ability to stop chatting at\nany time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>iMessage is one of Apple&#8217;s most underestimated assets. If iMessage were a startup, with exactly the same users, usage (a.k.a. &#8220;engagement&#8221;), and features, it could be worth <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/19/crazy-like-a-facebook-fox/\">tens of billions of dollars</a>. But because it&#8217;s <em>not</em> a startup, Apple is under no pressure to monetize the service in ways that annoy users.</p>\n\n<p>On the battery front:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Additionally, users can now see if the power management feature\nthat dynamically manages maximum performance to prevent unexpected\nshutdowns, first introduced in iOS 10.2.1, is on and can choose to\nturn it off. This feature can be found in Settings &#8594; Battery and\nis available for iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 6s,\niPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Being able to disable dynamic performance throttling is new &#8212; if I recall correctly, all Apple had promised last month was that iOS would soon <em>show</em> more information about your battery. [<strong>Update:</strong> The first mention of a switch to control this behavior was <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Business/apple-make-350b-contribution-us-economy-years/story?id=52405662\">in this interview Tim Cook gave to ABC News last week</a>.]</p>\n\n<p>Health:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The new Health Records feature brings together hospitals, clinics\nand the existing Health app to make it easy for consumers to see\ntheir available medical data from multiple providers, whenever\nthey choose. Patients from participating medical institutions will\nhave information from various institutions organized into one view\nand receive regular notifications for their lab results,\nmedications, conditions and more. Health Records data is encrypted\nand protected with a passcode.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This could be pretty awesome if it&#8217;s adopted widely by medical professionals. Apple has more information about the program <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/01/apple-announces-effortless-solution-bringing-health-records-to-iPhone/\">in a separate announcement</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Music:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Music will soon be the home for music videos. Users can\nstream all the music videos they want without being\ninterrupted by ads.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Gee, I wonder what video platform that&#8217;s a reference to?</p>\n\n<p>This whole 11.3 announcement is interesting. Some of these features &#8212; like Business Chat &#8212; are things I might have expected they&#8217;d hold for iOS 12. It&#8217;s almost like Apple held a little mini-WWDC over the last two days via Newsroom posts.</p>\n\n\n\n    "
